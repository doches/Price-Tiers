Price-Tiers
===========

Extract iOS price tiers from iTunes Connect and format them for MySQL. You're 
probably not too interested in the scripts and such here, though 
`price_tiers.sql` may be of some use. It contains a MySQL-friendly dump of two
database tables that replicate Apple's iOS price tier structure and can be used
to make queries like 'show me the prices at Tier 4' or 'show me the prices for
Switzerland'.
